# Multi Language Translation
In this example we can easily create a multilanguage website, we can easily convert our text into a multi dimensional array and can be utilize easily

1) open languages->index.php file in your localhost
2) copy text from view.php and paste it in input field
3) press submit

it will convert that text into array key and than add it into same file under language->english folder and than add a function to translate that key into view.php file
you can change filename later and add your own file.

Thanks
